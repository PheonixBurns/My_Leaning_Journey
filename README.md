# My_Learning_Journey - lease forgive spelling errors.

Day 1 - pre-course learning (08.03.23)
i have been revising HTML code and learning more about how the internet works. trying to refeesh from doing the homework (stage 2) to get on the cuorse. Having to reimind myself that I am on the first rung and doeasn't matter if there are others that know more. All that maters is that I am trying my best.  

Part of revising is looking at Codewars and Anki app both recommended by people on the School of Code meeting up last week. I have tried codeswars bit they dont have html but do have java script and other program languages so a good one to keep for later.
